## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
- is a private tutor
- has multiple students and classes
- can type fast
- skilled at using the command line

**Value proposition**:\
If a tutor has many students, it may be difficult to keep track of all of the students and the rates offered to each of them. TeachWhat! solves this issue by helping tutors manage their schedule, students and income more efficiently.
