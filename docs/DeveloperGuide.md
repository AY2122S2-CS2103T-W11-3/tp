### UI component
The **API** of this component is specified in `Ui.java`

![](images/UiPhotos/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of multiple parts eg. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, 
`StudentListPanel`, `InfoPanel` etc. All these components, including the `MainWindow` inherits from the abstract
`UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files 
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,
- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` component to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<img src="images/UiPhotos/BottomHalf.png" height="300" />

The bottom half of the `UI` component is split into two parts using a `SplitPane` component from 
the JavaFX UI framework. 

The left pane contains a `TabPane` that contains two tabs which hold a 
[`LessonListPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/LessonListPanel.java) and a
[`StudentListPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/StudentListPanel.java).
The **_Lessons_** tab contains a 
[`LessonListPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/LessonListPanel.java) which lists out `Lesson` entries 
while the **_Students_** tab contains a 
[`StudentListPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/listpanel/StudentListPanel.java) which lists out `Student`
entries.

[//]: # (COMMENT OUT LATER: might not need to reference methods here, might do it in the implementation section)
To switch between the tabs, the methods `MainWindow#toggleLessonTab()` and `MainWindow#toggleStudentTab()` can be used 
to switch between the **_Lesson_** tab and **_Student_** tab respectively. Switching the tabs by using user commands is 
done by the method `MainWindow#toggleTab()`.

![img.png](images/UiPhotos/InfoPanelClassDiagram.png)

The right pane contains an [`InfoPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/InfoPanel.java) 
component can either show the details of a `Lesson` entry or `Student` entry. A
[`LessonInfoPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/LessonInfoPanel.java) is used to show the details of a 
`Lesson` entry, while a [`StudentInfoPanel`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/infopanel/StudentInfoPanel.java) is used
to show the details of a `Student` entry.

[//]: # (COMMENT OUT LATER: might not need to reference methods here, might do it in the implementation section)
The methods `MainWindow#populateInfoPanelWithLesson()` and `MainWindow#populateInfoPanelWithStudent()` can be used to
populate the `InfoPanel` with the provided entry. Populating the `InfoPanel` using user commands is handled by the 
method `MainWindow#handleInfoPanelUpdate()`.

### Logic component

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `ModelManager` component,
* stores the student book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the lesson book data i.e., all `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `ConsistentLessonList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.

the `ModelManager` component also,
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* similarly, it stores the currently 'selected' `Lesson` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

![Model Class Diagram](images/LessonBookStudentBookModelClassDiagram.png)
Each `Lesson` has an association with a list of `EnrolledStudents`, which contains references to each `Student` assigned to the lesson.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Add student
Adding a `Student` to the `StudentBook` 
### Add temporary/recurring lesson
Adding a lesson is enabled by the `ConsistentLessonList` class, which ensures that no lessons in record clash with one another.

This is achieved by enforcing ***consistency*** between existing lessons stored in the list.

A list of lessons is considered ***consistent*** when no lessons clash with each another. In particular, the following two conditions are enforced by the `ConsistentLessonList`:
- no two temporary lessons should have overlapping timeslots (ie: a lesson should ***not*** start when another lesson has not ended)
- no recurring lesson should have overlapping timeslots with any temporary lesson or recurring lesson that falls on the same weekday as it

This is done with the method `ConsistentLessonList#hasConflictingLesson()`, which takes in a `Lesson` that is to be added to the list and returns true if any existing lessons clashes with it.

Given below is an example scenario:

Step 1. The user requests to add a lesson that,
- is on 20 March 2022
- starts at 12 pm
- lasts for 1 hour

![Add Lesson Object Diagram](images/AddLessonObjectDiagram_1.png)

Step 2. The method `ConsistentLessonList#add()` is called, with the new lesson passed in as the argument. The method `ConsistentLessonList#hasConflictingLesson()` is then called, which checks if the first existing lesson clashes with this one using the method `Lesson#isConflictingWithLesson()`.

![Add Lesson Object Diagram](images/AddLessonObjectDiagram_2.png)

Step 3. The method then moves down the list and checks if the second existing lesson clashes with this one using the method `Lesson#isConflictingWithLesson()`.

![Add Lesson Object Diagram](images/AddLessonObjectDiagram_3.png)

After all the existing lessons have been verified to not clash with the new lesson, it is added to the list of lessons.

### Assign student to lesson

The feature assigns a `Student` to a `Lesson`. The `AssignCommand` class 
extends the `Command` and overwrites the `Command#execute()` method.

Using the `Model` object passed in as an argument of the `AssignCommand#execute()`
method, the following methods are invoked in the `AssignCommand#execute()` method:
* `Model#updateAssignment()`
    * adds `Student` to the `enrolledStudents` attribute `Lesson`
    * adds `Lesson` to the `enrolledLessons` attribute of the `Student`
* `Model#setSelectedStudent()` - sets the `selectedStudent` attribute of `Model` to
the `Student` that is being assigned. This is done to display the `Student` details
in the `MainWindow#InfoPanel`.


The `AssignCommand#execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` upon a
successful assignment.


Given below is an example usage scenario on how the assign command works.

####Step 1: The user launches the application and executes the following
* `addlesson -n Sec 2 Math...` which adds a `Lesson` named "Sec 2 Math".
* `addstudent -n David...` which adds a `Student` named "David".

![](../src/main/resources/images/AssignState0-Initial_state.png)

#### Step 2: The user executes the following to find the respective IDs of the `Student` and `Lesson`.
* `listlessons` command to see that the `Lesson` named "Sec 2 Math" has a `LESSON_ID` of 1.
* `liststudents` command to see that the `Student` named "David" has a `STUDENT_ID` of 1.

#### Step 3: The user executes the command `assign -s 1 -l 1`. The command does the following:
* adds `Student` "David" to the `enrolledStudents` attribute of the `Lesson` "Sec 2 Math".
* adds `Lesson` "Sec 2 Math" to the `enrolledLessons` attribute of the `Student` "David".

The following sequence diagram shows how the assign operation works.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
- is a private tutor
- has multiple students and classes
- can type fast
- skilled at using the command line

**Value proposition**:\
If a tutor has many students, it may be difficult to keep track of all of the students and the rates offered to each of them. TeachWhat! solves this issue by helping tutors manage their schedule, students and income more efficiently.
