###Enhancements implemented
1. Student Functionality
   (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/71) and [#146](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/146))
   - What it does
     - Allows user to Add/Delete/Edit a `Student`.
2. Added support for optional prefixes in `Student`
   - What it does
     - All prefixes except for `Name` and `Phone` are optional.
   - Justification
     - The user does not need to know the address or email of every student.
3. Command Shortcuts
   - What it does
     - Provides support for shortcut command words.
   - Justification
     - This makes typing faster, instead of typing `addstudent`, the user can simply use `as`.
4. Help Page
    - What it does
      - Displays a table with the description, command word, command shortcut for each command.
      - A hyperlink to TeachWhat! user guide.
    - Justification
      - It makes it easier for the user to refer to command words and their functionality using the table instead of 
      opening the user guide.
      - The user can simply click on the hyperlink and it opens the user guide on their default browser. This saves the user time.
