## Project: TeachWhat!

TeachWhat! is a desktop address book application used for private tutors in managing their class. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

### Enhancements implemented
1. Student Functionality
   (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/71) and [#146](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/146))
   - What it does
     - Allows user to Add/Delete/Edit a `Student`.
2. Added support for optional prefixes in `Student`
   (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/71)
    - What it does
     - All prefixes except for `Name` and `Phone` are optional.
   - Justification
     - The user does not need to know the address or email of every student.
3. Command Shortcuts
   (Pull requests [#145](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/145)
   - What it does
     - Provides support for shortcut command words.
   - Justification
     - This makes typing faster, instead of typing `addstudent`, the user can simply use `as`.
4. Help Page
   (Pull requests [#158](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/158)
   - What it does
     - Displays a table with the description, command word, command shortcut for each command.
     - A hyperlink to TeachWhat! user guide.
   - Justification
     - It makes it easier for the user to refer to command words and their functionality using the table instead of 
        opening the user guide.
     - The user can simply click on the hyperlink to open it instead of copying it. This saves the user time.

### Contributions to the UG
      
1. Created the initial format and draft of the user guide on our Team's shared google docs.
2. Updated the user guide to use consistent wording.

### Contributions to the DG

1. Added functionality and use-cases for `AddStudent` command.
2. Added Sequence Diagram for `AddStudent` command.

### Contributions to team-based tasks
1. Created and assigned tasks to milestones 1.3 and 1.4
2. Created 1.3.1 release and uploaded its jar file

### Review/mentoring contributions
1. Made multiple good suggestions when reviewing PRs [#92](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/92#issuecomment-1072136978), 
2. Debated with [james]() about how command shortcuts were to be implemented and justified my use of `Fallthroughs` over creating a `list` to hold all the command words for every command because we decided to not implement user specified keybinds.
3. Spotted bugs made that were not caught such as [#249](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/issues/249) and [#73](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/73/files) and provided suggestions to fix them.
